# lockers

Thank you for taking the time to look my code! 

I have used Minitest as my testing suite. 

Fork & Clone the repository to your machine and run ruby main.rb from the lockers directory. 
From there just follow the instruction the program gives you!

Let me know if you have any questions!

# Problem:

Write a program for managing locker reservations at a hotel concierge desk. Customers leave bags with the concierge, 
who then uses your program to determine in which locker to place the bag. The program tells the concierge the number 
of the locker in which to place the bag, and prints a ticket to give to the customer. Upon return, the customer 
provides the ticket, and the concierge uses that to look up the corresponding locker, retrieve the bag, and return 
it to the customer.

There are 1000 small lockers, 1000 medium sized lockers, and 1000 large lockers (itâ€™s a big Vegas hotel). You can 
assume that all checked bags fit into one of these three sizes. The program should always assign the smallest available
locker that fits the bag.
